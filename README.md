# Markdown Authoring & Publishing Platform

A modern **Next.js** app that allows authors to **create, edit, delete, and publish Markdown files** directly to GitHub. Drafts are persisted locally, and published files are committed to a GitHub repository safely using environment variables. The app also fetches and renders Markdown files from GitHub as sanitized HTML.
